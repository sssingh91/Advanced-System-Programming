-----------program details------------------------

-> Dynamic 2-D array is made as buffer. And the solution is implemeted using mutexes and condition variables.
-> lock is made to wait if buffer is full in producer and is signalled by consumer when there is 'buffsize - 1' element in buffer.
-> lock is made to wait in consumer if buffer is empty and is signalled by producer when there is '1' element in buffer.
-> when producer is getting terminated, a global variable 'k' value is changed to '1' and consumer also terminates after removing all the items from buffer when k =1.
-> As consumer terminates it signals consumer if it is in sleep/wait, if consumer is not waiting that signal will be lost.
